Resources for Authenticating Programmatically
The auth system in this app is database-based, so authenticating against a test database works fine. However, many auth systems do not test against a database -- such as Auth0 using Universal Login with Google, or SSO systems.

Authenticating programmatically for these auth systems is outside scope of this course, but here are some resources that you may find helpful:

[Cypress Auth0 Authentication](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/testing-strategies/auth0-authentication#What-you-ll-learn) (and other “testing strategies” in this section of the Cypress docs)
